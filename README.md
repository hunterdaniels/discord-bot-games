ðŸŽ® Web-Based Games
To provide a truly interactive and visually appealing gaming experience, POE includes several games hosted as static web applications. When a user issues a command like !playtictactoe, the bot will provide a link to the corresponding game's web page.

The game logic and UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are entirely client-side. While the games run independently, a future enhancement could involve a small backend API to allow these web games to report scores directly back to the bot's database.

Example Game Links:
